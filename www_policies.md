This Privacy Policy is effective as of May 16, 2014.

We may collect two types of personally identifiable information: your name and grade level, which you (or an Authorized Person) have voluntarily submitted to us.

We may collect, maintain and use contact information you (or an Authorized Person) have voluntarily submitted so that we can contact you to respond to your comments or requests for information.

The Site allows students to interact online with Company employed, state-certified, security-cleared math teachers for the purpose of math instruction. Information provided by you through this manner is treated as personally identifiable information.

DATA SHARING AND TRANSFER

The Company will provide data and the personal identifiable information on individual students and the analysis of trends for all students on an aggregate basis to some or all of the following (collectively “Customer”): the state education agency, the school district, a student’s school or a students teacher. The Company provides such information as a service to its Customer but it does not control the use of such data after it provides it to the Customer. Consequently, the Company takes no responsibility or liability for the use of such data after it provides it to the Customer.

Think Through Learning, Inc., does not provide, sell or lend any personally identifiable information to any third party.

The Company reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information based on the good faith belief that such action is necessary or appropriate to: (a) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company, or (b) act in urgent circumstances to protect the safety or security of a student, the public or of users of the Company’s services and/or the Site.

Your personal information will generally be stored in the Company’s databases, which are located in the United States. Specific information is provided on the Site’s consent or registration form, where needed. Our policy is to ensure that your information is always granted the same level of protection no matter where it is stored. In the event that the Company is involved in a transaction such as a merger, stock purchase or sale, or sale of substantially all of the Company’s assets, personal information may be transferred to the other party in such transaction under the same level of security it had before the transaction.

USE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

The Company stores only the student records provided to us by our Customers. As a custodian of student personally-identifiable information (PII), the Company complies with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) in its handling of student records. Upon termination or cancellation of a Customer contract, the Company will delete all personally identifiable student data from its records. The Company may retain aggregate, non-identifying student usage information for the purpose of reporting, analytics, and improving the Company’s products and services.

Upon our collection of your personally identifiable information, the Company may use such personally identifiable information internally, separately or in combination with pre-existing information, for the following purposes:

*   To provide any requested services;
*   To troubleshoot problems with the Site, or any services, as requested;
*   To improve our products
*   To customize your experience, content or homepage on the Site;
*   To enforce our Terms of Use;
*   To generate aggregate statistical studies and conduct research; or

Think Through Learning, Inc., does not provide, sell or lend any personally identifiable information to any third party.

COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

Cookies help us in many ways to make your use of the Site more enjoyable and meaningful, such as understanding usage patterns and improving functionality of the Site. Cookies are text information files that your web browser places on your computer when you use a website. The Company and/or its third party suppliers, licensors or agents may use such “cookie” technology to obtain non-personal information from you. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to accept them or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. The Company and/or its third party suppliers, licensors or agents may also use so-called “web beacons” to access the information contained in its cookies. These cookies do not store personally identifiable information.

SECURITY

We take steps to make all information received from you online as secure as reasonably possible against unauthorized access and use.

ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION

We attempt to keep your files complete, up-to-date, and accurate. If you enrolled directly, you may update your personal information in one of the following ways:

1.  You may contact us at [info@thinkthroughmath.com](mailto:info@thinkthroughmath.com)  for any inquiry or request regarding our Privacy Policy or the handling of your personal information.
2.  You may unsubscribe to any of our e-mails by following the unsubscribe instructions in the body of any e-mail message.
3.  You also may write to us directly if you wish to: (a) update or delete your contact information; or (b) request that we cease sending you promotional or other information via mail or e-mail. Such written requests should be sent to the Company at the address below.

If you (or your student) was enrolled by an Authorized Person, you will have limited ability to edit your information. If you register your student and your student is later enrolled by an Authorized Person, the primary rights to edit the student’s information revert to the Authorized Person. If you would like to update, delete or modify any of your personal information or your preferences, please contact your Authorized Person.

CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

The Company is strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy of children who use the Site. We do not knowingly collect personal information online from children under 13 without consent from the parent or guardian or an Authorized Person.

When provided by a parent or guardian or an Authorized Person, we may receive two pieces of personally identifiable information; the name and grade level of a child under 13, which such parent, guardian or Authorized Person has voluntarily submitted. The Company will provide such information to its Customer, as described in the “Data Sharing and Transfer” section above, and the Company takes no responsibility or liability for the use of such data after it provides it to the Customer. The Company may also use such information so that we can improve the products we provide to our Customer’s to better meet their needs.

Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child’s participation in an activity – like contests – on the child’s disclosure of more personal information than is necessary to participate in the activity. This means if we don’t need a specific piece of information (like the child’s email address) to allow the child to participate in a contest, we will not ask for it.

A parent or guardian or Authorized Person who has given the Company permission to collect and use a child’s personal information can modify, update, correct a child’s information or discontinue further collection or use of a child’s information in accordance with the procedures described in the “Access to Your Information” section above.
