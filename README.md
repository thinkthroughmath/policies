Think Through Learning's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
=====================

At Think Through Learning, we take the security and privacy of the data our clients entrust to us very seriously. We have elected to make our privacy policies and terms of use for our [Think Through Math platform](https://lms.thinkthroughmath.com), as well as our [public Website](https://www.thinkthroughmath.com), available in an open source format so that any changes we make can be tracked over time.

HOWTO: Open source your company's policies
==========================================
1. [Create your own repository](https://github.com/new) named *policies* or [fork ours](https://github.com/clever/policies#fork-destination-box).

2. Add your current policies to the repository:
  - Include your Terms of Service, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other policy documents that relate to schools, students, and teachers using your service.
  - Protip: The [HTML to Markdown](https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/) converter makes it easy to generate plain text versions of your existing policies.

3. Use [Git branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) and [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to manage changes in your policies.

4. Let everyone know by tweeting your repository with the hashtag [#opensourceprivacy](https://twitter.com/search?q=opensourceprivacy&src=typd) and request addition to [PrivacyByChoice](http://privacybychoice.github.io/) page.
